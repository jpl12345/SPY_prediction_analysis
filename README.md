## About 
This objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for the S&amp;P500 stock index using economic indicators from FRED, Federal Reserve Economic Data, an online database consisting of hundreds of thousands of publicly available economic data time series, to find entry points and indicators to purchase, sell or hold in the stock market to maximise returns.


Indicators used from FRED for prediction (subject to expansion and change):
1. GDP (Gross domestic product)
2. CPIAUCSL (Get Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average)
3. UNRATE (Unemployment Rate)
4. AMTMNO (Manufacturers' New Orders: Total Manufacturing)
5. POILWTIUSDM (Global price of WTI Crude)
6. AAA10Y (Moody's Seasoned Aaa Corporate Bond Yield Relative to Yield on 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity)
7. CSCICP03USM665S (Consumer Opinion Surveys: Confidence Indicators: Composite Indicators: OECD Indicator for the United States)
8. T10Y3M (10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 3-Month Treasury Constant Maturity)
9. VIXCLS (CBOE Volatility Index: VIX)
10. BSCICP03USM665S (Business Tendency Surveys for Manufacturing: Confidence Indicators: Composite Indicators: OECD Indicator for the United States)


ML techniques used for prediction (subject to expansion and change):
- XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosted Decision Tree)
